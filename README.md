# Genesis for Analogue Pocket with support for Analogizer-FPGA adapter
* Analogizer V1.0.0   [22/06/2024]: Added initial support for Analogizer adapter (RGBS, RGsB, YPbPr, Y/C, SVGA Scandoubler)
* Analogizer V1.0.1   [23/06/2024]: Fixed truncated last scanline.
* Analogizer V1.0.2   [19/01/2025]: Added PSX digital/DS/DS2 SNAC support (SCPH-1010, SPCH-1080,SCPH-1180, SCPH-1200, SCPH-10010 and clones). Fixed video output.

The Analogizer interface allow to mix game inputs from compatible SNAC gamepads supported by Analogizer (DB15 Neogeo, NES, SNES, PCEngine, PSX) with Analogue Pocket built-in controls or from Dock USB or wireless supported controllers (Analogue support).

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:
```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
``` 

The following options exist in the core menu to configure Analogizer:
* **SNAC Adapter** List: None, DB15,NES,SNES,PCE,PCE Multitap, SNES swap A,B<->X,Y buttons, PSX (Digital DPAD), PSX (Analog DPAD), PSX (P1 Lightgun). The Lightgun option uses PSX Analogic stick as SNES Lightgun aiming track.
* **SNAC Controller Assignment** List: several options about how to map SNAC controller to Pocket controls. The controls not mapped to SNAC by default will map to Pocket connected controllers (Pocket built-in or Dock).
* **Analogizer Video Out** List: you can choose between RGBS (VGA to SCART), RGsB (works is a PVM as YPbPr but using RGB color space), YPbPr (for TV with component video input),
Y/C NTSC or PAL (for SVideo o compositive video using Y/C Active adapter by Mike S11), RGBHV for SVGA monitor Scandouble video output.

**Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.

Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

For output Y/C and composite video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC` or `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC,Pocket OFF` for NTSC. You need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C PAL` or `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C PAL,Pocket OFF` for PAL.

For output Scandoubler SVGA video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Scandoubler RGBHV`.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.

## Important to read this first!
- This core is far from complete and I am aware of most issues.
- No PAL.
